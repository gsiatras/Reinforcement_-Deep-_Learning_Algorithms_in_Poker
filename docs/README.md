# Creating Reinforcement Learning agents on rlcard enviroment		

# New limit holdem game
A limit holdem mode with shorter deck 4x(A, 10, J, Q, K), 1 hand card, 2 public cards		
Purpose: Shorter state space, test simplier algorithms		
Threshold Agent:		
Rule based model betting only on highcards
		
# Algorithms Implemented
Currently implementing a policy iteration algorithm agent: MDPAgent:		
Results in graphs in examples/experiments
